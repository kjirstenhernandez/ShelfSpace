# Overview

ShelfSpace is an online media tracking app that allows users to catalog their owned media, including movies, books, music, and TV shows, in a virtual "media shelf" for improved organization and easy access.

Users can create accounts secured through JWT authentication. Upon logging in, they can view their media shelf, add, edit, and delete media items, as well as filter and search through their collections.

This was a team project, and my contributions included implementing authorization and authentication, developing the "Create Account" page and its functionality, and debugging the "Add" and "Edit" features for individual media items.

# Development Environment

ShelfSpace is primarily written in C# using the Blazor framework, with Razor as the template engine. Development was done in Visual Studio Code. While we attempted to deploy the application using Azure, we were unable to make the site live and publicly accessible.
